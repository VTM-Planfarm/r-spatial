# r-spatial

This repository serves as my personal R-based spatial analysis hubâ€”a central workspace for testinggeospatial workflows. It brings together commonly used spatial data manipulation techniques, visualization tools, and analysis routines, primarily using packages such as `sf`, `terra`. The goal is to streamline spatial data handling and promote reusable, reproducible code for research and reporting.
